What is she running from? Even she doesn't know. She goes to the Saint-Louis cathedral, where she meets her friend Ram, an ice lolly seller, who shares with her his simple human wisdom; Sanjay, the shy student who loves her secretly and tries in vain to muster up the courage to tell her; and all her other friends, who feel her charm and her grace as a secret light, when she dances on the steps in front of the cathedral. Of the cathedral, she only knows the stone steps on which she sits or dances. And yet, the cathedral, who is telling us this story, waits for her every day and embraces her with its mystical presence without her being aware of it. Yet, on this particular day, the routine of Lina's days is changed. A stranger, a photographer looking for unusual images of the island, happens to see her while she is dancing, and tries to entice her with a vision of a different future. Lina's narrow, enclosed world opens up suddenly, and her habits are disrupted. Her life is changed because she is forced to make a choice. To decide whether she will accept to meet the photographer again, and take up this opportunity to leave the dust and noise of the city, the poverty of her life and a family that seems to be falling apart, or refuse to open up to this dream. Whether she accepts or refuses, her life will no longer be the same and she will no longer be free: she will have faced up to the reality of her existence. We will never know whether it is the right choice or not. But that's not the point. The point is that, in the course of this single day in Port-Louis, a carefree young girl has finally grown up.","English, French, Morisyen",Mauritius,tt1042258,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,"inspiring, emotional",fast,intimate,"love, friendship, family",female,surreal,neutral,"redemption, growth",original,low,minimal,low,0,0,0,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

An orphan without family, money, or resources, at her arrival to the Aiport of Barajas in the City of Madrid, María meets Amparo, a funny, loudmouthed, vivacious, free-spirited woman who works as a flight attendant. Three months later María is living with Amparo, also working as a flight attendant in Barajas, when she meets again Pablo, now looking for a lost suitcase. After he gives her his work address, the suitcase is found and María takes it to return to Pablo, surprised to learn that he works in TVE (Televisión Española, a Spanish TV channel back then). There she meets Chimo, a womanizing producer determined to turn María into a star as one of the dancers in the famous late show ""Las Noches de Rosa."" Returning to her work at the airport, at the last moment she meets Pablo and gives him his suitcase and her phone number, which leads to a double date with Amparo and Lucas. When Chimo locates María, he convinces her to participate in the show. However, troubles appear by three: Rosa mistrusts María and places her as a possible substitute in case one of the other dancers is absent, and Pablo's father Celedonio is TVE's censor, an old-fashioned man stuck in the early days of Franco's dictatorship, who rejects any kind of modernity and freedom in TV and who wants to fire Chimo. Unfamiliar with the Francoist Regime and its repressive laws, María tries to adjust to it, although she thinks it's outdated. Then Massimiliano appears in Madrid looking for María, trying to win her back. While Amparo's relationship with Lucas sours, María's dream of making her first appearance on TV is shattered after seeing she's been considerably censored. Taking revenge on Pablo after knowing about his relationship with María, Chimo shows her the censor's office, where she discovers that Pablo is Celedonio's son and will be the new censor when his father retires--but it was Pablo himself who actually censored her, on his father's advice. With their relationship in danger, Massimiliano finds and reunites with María, who feels confused about her feelings for Pablo. At the same time, Celedonio forces TVE's staff to choose his son as new censor, betraying Pablo when Celedonio imposes the condition to continue working as a counselor for his son. With the incoming New Year's Eve Special, which will also be the first Special to be broadcast live, María and Pablo are trapped at crossroads: he's between following his father's way or his own; she weighs going back to Rome with Massimiliano against following her dreams of dance and freedom.",Spanish,"Spain, Italy",tt11238932,movie,N/A,N/A,N/A,"funny, emotional, dark",fast,intimate,"friendship, revenge, justice, love, family, betrayal",ensemble,surreal,neutral,growth,original,low,minimal,medium,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The LURD wanted to overthrow the government. They terrorized the people in the country through killings, rapes, dismemberment and destruction. They were becoming more powerful as they closed in on the capital city, Monrovia. One unlikely heroine is inspired by a dream to bring Christian women together to start a peace movement. She begins within her own church and asks that all women from all churches are brought together. At one meeting, a Muslim woman goes up to the podium to address the church and tells them that she is moved by what they were doing and that Muslim women need to be brought into the Peace Movement. This was a cause that transcended all differences. With this extraordinary mission, the women dressed in plain white clothes and covered their heads, as a way to shed any differences of class or religion among them. They decide to make peace signs and sit in at the fish market where the Liberian president drove past every morning. He refuses to acknowledge them for weeks. The women finally get to present their mission statement to the president, as well as demand peace talks between the government and the rebels. The women do not just hand things over to the men, however. When the peace talks finally come to fruition, a delegate group goes to Ghana to ensure that a resolution is made. The first two weeks no progress is made. The rebel warlords are just demanding future positions in the government and access to the country's resources. The Liberian president had already fled back to Liberia when Sierra Leone tries to indict him for war crimes. The women's growing anger and frustration lead them to stage a sit in. They block all the doors and windows preventing anyone from leaving the peace talks without a resolution. Trapped with no food and water, the talks turn serious. Finally, a resolution is signed. The UN peacekeepers move in and the Liberian president is exiled to Nigeria. The women understood that they could not rely on anyone else to make sure that the resolutions are implemented. They also realize, seeing the UN only creating chaos, that to ensure full disarmament in the country, they would need to step in, forgive their perpetrators, and convince each one of them that they would be accepted back into the community.
